## 1. Course Outline
This course covers the basic principles and theoretical structures of quantum mechanics, which are requisite
for understanding modern physics. Topics includes the classical mechanics and its limitation, the birth of wave
mechanics and the uncertainty principle, the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics, Schrödinger equation,
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, one-dimensional problems, the general structure of wave mechanics,
operator methods in quantum mechanics, and N-particle systems.
