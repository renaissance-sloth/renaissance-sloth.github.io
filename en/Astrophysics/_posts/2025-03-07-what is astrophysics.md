# What is Astronomy?

Astronomy is the study of the movement and rules of celestial bodies floating in space. If we analyze the word itself, it means 'astro' (star, floating) and 'nomy' (rule, division), which shows that astronomy is the study of the movement of stars and celestial bodies in the sky.

## Ancient Astronomy

The history of astronomy goes back a long time. Ancient civilizations observed the sky and accumulated various astronomical knowledge. The representative areas where ancient astronomy developed are as follows.

- **India**
- **Egypt**
- **Sumer**
- **Greece**

They studied constellations, seasonal changes, and the movements of the sun and moon, and used them to create calendars, agriculture, and religious ceremonies.

## What Astronomy Explains

Astronomy studies the regular movements of the planets to explain seasonal changes, lunar phases, and comet appearances. This is ultimately connected to astrology, and in the past, astronomy and astrology were not separated but studied together.

- **Seasons**
- **Moon’s Phase Change**
- **Halley’s Comet**
- **Retrograde Motion of Mars**

These **regular planetary movements** were later organized into astronomical **laws**.

## Heliocentrism vs. Heliocentric Theory Vs. Geocentric Theory

### 1. Geocentric Theory

- **Claudius Ptolemaeus (AD 83~168)**
- Author: *Almagest (AD 140)*
- Proposed **epicycle theory** to explain **the retrograde motion of Mars**.

### 2. Heliocentric Theory

- **Nicolaus Copernicus (1473~1543)**
- Argued **heliocentric theory** centered on the sun
- Naturally explained retrograde motion.

## Competition of Heliocentric and Geocentric Theories

The heliocentric and geocentric theories have been the subject of debate for a long time, and various scholars have studied and published modified theories.

- **Ptolemaeus**
- **Copernicus**
- **Revised geocentric theory (Tycho Brahe, 1546~1601)**
- Proposed a modified model to explain the phases of Venus
- **Kepler's Laws (Johannes Kepler, 1571~1630)**
- Summarized the empirical laws explaining the motion of celestial bodies

### Kepler's Laws

1. **Elliptic Motion**
- The orbits of planets are ellipses with the Sun at their focus. 2. **Area Law**
- The line connecting the Sun and a planet sweeps equal areas in equal amounts of time.

3. **Harmonic Law**
- The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.

## Newton & Universal Gravitation

- **Isaac Newton (1642~1726)**
- Explained Kepler's Laws mathematically
- Revealed that the motion of all celestial bodies is determined by **Newton's Universal Gravitation**.

### Newton's Laws

- The principle of an apple falling to the ground and a planet orbiting is the same.
- **All objects with mass attract each other.**
- This principle **applies not only to the Solar System but also to stars and the entire universe**.

## Astrophysics

The field that combines astronomy and physics is called **Astrophysics**. It is a discipline that explains various astronomical phenomena in the universe through fundamental physical laws.

- **Observation Object**: Position (angle) and brightness (spectrum) of stars
- **Goal**: Explain the structure and history of the universe based on physical laws

Kepler's law is used to explain **the motion of two celestial bodies (Kepler's law: Two Body Motion)**.

$P^{2} = \frac{4\pi^{2}}{G(M+m)}a^{3} $

Through this research, we can understand the origin and structure of the universe more deeply.
