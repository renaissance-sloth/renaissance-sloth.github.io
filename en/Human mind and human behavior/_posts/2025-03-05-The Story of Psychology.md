- Using research methods based on evidence
    - Observation and experimentation (empirical approach)
- Need for a scientific attitude
    - Curiosity

    - Skeptical attitude
        - What does it mean?

        > Researchers must be willing to marvel at new ideas and pursue them. People and animals do not behave as certain ideas and beliefs predict.
