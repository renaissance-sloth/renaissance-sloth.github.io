## 1. Course Outline
This course introduces plasma phenomena relevant to energy generation by controlled fusion, laser-matter
interactions, and astro-physics.  It will cover basic plasma properties and collective behavior, motions of
charged particle in magnetic field, equalibrium and instabilities.  Several special topics in morden plasma
physics research will be discussed too.
