# Classical Mechanics II. Final exam (Thur. Dec. 19th, 2024)

0. Write your name on "each" page of the answer sheet.

1. [ ] Short answers (no-derivation)

   (a) Write down the wave equation

   (b) Helmholtz equation

   (c) The plane-wave solution

   (d) Spherical wave solution

   (e) Parabolic wave solution

   Derivation

   (f) Let's consider the interference of two waves with the same amplitude.
       Phases of two wave are φ1 and φ2. Find the expression of intensity as a function of the
       phase difference, and plot it.

2. [25 pt] The N₂ and O₂ molecules in the air behave very much like hard spheres of radius R.
   Let's estimate the mean-free-path of an air molecule.
   To simplify our discussion, we shall assume that one chosen molecule moves through the gas,
   and all the other molecules are stationary.

   (a) First, let's imagine a thin slice of gas with thickness dx.
       The total number of molecules and the volume of slice are N and V, respectively.
       What are "collisional cross-section, σ", "target density, n_tar" of this slice, and "the
       probability that a molecule will make a collision in this slice".

   (b) Let's define a function "p(x)": the probability that the projectile travels a distance x
       without making any collision. Find it.

   (c) The mean-free-path λ is the average value of x. Find it.

   (d) Typical size of N2 or O2 molecules is R ~ 0.15 nm. At STP, 22.4 liters of air contains one
       mole (6.02x10²³) of molecules.
       Estimate λ.

3. [25 pt] A piano string of length *L* is fixed at both ends. The string has a linear mass density *μ* and is under tension *T*.

   (a) Find the general solution for the vibration of the string.
       What are the allowed frequencies and wavelengths?

   (b) At time t=0, the string is pulled as shown in the figure. Find the ensuing motion of the string, using the Fourier analysis method.

4. [25 pt]

One can set up a two-dimensional scattering theory, which could be applied to puck projectiles sliding on an ice rink and colliding with various target obstacles. The cross section *σ* would be the effective width of a target, and the differential cross section *dσ*/*dθ* would give the number of projectiles scattered in the angle *dθ*.

**(a)** Show that the two-dimensional analog of (14.23) is *dσ*/*dθ* = |*db*/*dθ*|. (Note that in two-dimensional scattering it is convenient to let *θ* range from −*π* to *π*.)

$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{b}{\sin\theta}\left|\frac{db}{d\theta}\right|. \tag{eq. 14.23}$$

**(b)** Now consider the scattering of a small projectile off a hard "sphere" (actually a hard disk) of radius *R* pinned down to the ice. Find the differential cross section. (Note that in two dimensions, hard "sphere" scattering is not isotropic.)

**(c)** By integrating your answer to part (b), show that the total cross section is 2*R* as expected.
