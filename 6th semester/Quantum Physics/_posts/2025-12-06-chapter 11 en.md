# 📚 CHAPTER 11 SCATTERING

## 11.1 INTRODUCTION

### 11.1.1 Classical Scattering Theory

Imagine a particle incident on some **scattering center** (say, a proton fired at a heavy nucleus). It comes in with energy $E$ and **impact parameter** $b$ and it emerges at some **scattering angle** $\theta$. (I'll assume for simplicity that the target is azimuthally symmetrical, so the trajectory remains in one plane, and that the target is very heavy, so the recoil is negligible.) The essential problem of classical scattering theory is this: **Given the impact parameter, calculate the scattering angle**. Ordinarily, of course, the smaller the impact parameter, the greater the scattering angle.

### Example 11.1 Hard-sphere scattering.

Suppose the target is a **billiard ball**, of radius $R$, and the incident particle is a BB, which bounces off **elastically** (Figure 11.2).

 

In terms of the angle $\alpha$, the impact parameter is $b=R \sin \alpha$, and the scattering angle is $\theta=\pi-2 \alpha$, so
$$b=R \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\theta}{2}\right)=R \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \text { }$$
Evidently
$$\theta=\begin{cases}2 \cos ^{-1}(b/R), & \text { if } b \le R \\ 0, & \text { if } b \ge R.\end{cases} \text { }$$

More generally, particles incident within an infinitesimal patch of cross-sectional area $d \sigma$ will scatter into a corresponding infinitesimal solid angle $d \Omega$ (Figure 11.3). The larger $d \sigma$ is, the bigger $d \Omega$ will be; the proportionality factor, $D(\theta) \equiv d \sigma/d \Omega$, is called the **differential (scattering) cross-section**:

> This is terrible language: $D$ isn't a differential, and it isn't a cross-section. To my ear, the words "differential cross-section" would attach more naturally to $d \sigma$. But I'm afraid we're stuck with this terminology. I should also warn you that the notation $D(\theta)$ is nonstandard: Most people just call it $d \sigma/d \Omega$-which makes Equation 11.3 look like a tautology. I think it will be less confusing if we give the differential cross-section its own symbol.

> **FIGURE 11.3:** Particles incident in the area $d \sigma$ scatter into the solid angle $d \Omega$.

$$d \sigma=D(\theta) d \Omega \text { }$$

In terms of the impact parameter $b$ and the azimuthal angle $\phi$, $d \sigma=b d b d \phi$ and $d \Omega=\sin \theta d \phi$, so
$$D(\theta)=\frac{b}{\sin \theta}\left|\frac{d b}{d \theta}\right| \text { }$$

(Since $\theta$ is typically a decreasing function of $b$, the derivative is actually negative-hence the absolute value sign.) 

### Example 11.2 Hard-sphere scattering (continued).

In the case of hard-sphere scattering (Example 11.1),
$$\frac{d b}{d \theta}=-\frac{1}{2} R \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \text { }$$
so
$$D(\theta)=\frac{R \cos (\theta/2)}{\sin \theta}\left(\frac{R \sin (\theta/2)}{2}\right)=\frac{R^{2}}{4} \text { }$$

This example is unusual, in that the differential cross-section is independent of $\theta$.

The **total cross-section** is the integral of $D(\theta)$, over all solid angles:
$$\sigma \equiv \int D(\theta) d \Omega \text { }$$

---
## 📄 Page 4

roughly speaking, it is the total area of incident beam that is scattered by the target. For example, in the case of hard-sphere scattering,
$$\sigma=\left(R^{2} / 4\right) \int d \Omega=\pi R^{2} \text { }$$
which is just what we would expect: It's the cross-sectional area of the sphere; BB's incident within this area will hit the target, and those farther out will miss it completely. But the virtue of the formalism developed here is that it applies just as well to "soft" targets (such as the Coulomb field of a nucleus) that are not simply "hit-or-miss".

Finally, suppose we have a beam of incident particles, with uniform intensity (or **luminosity**, as particle physicists call it):
$$\mathcal{L} \equiv \text { number of incident particles per unit area, per unit time. } \text { }$$
The number of particles entering area $d \sigma$ (and hence scattering into solid angle $d \Omega$), per unit time, is $d N=\mathcal{L} d \sigma=\mathcal{L} D(\theta) d \Omega$, so
$$D(\theta)=\frac{1}{\mathcal{L}} \frac{d N}{d \Omega} \text { }$$
This is often taken as the definition of the differential cross-section, because it makes reference only to quantities easily measured in the laboratory: If the detector accepts particles scattering into a solid angle $d \Omega$, we simply count the number recorded, per unit time, divide by $d \Omega$, and normalize to the luminosity of the incident beam.

### ***Problem 11.1 Rutherford scattering.

An incident particle of charge $q_{1}$ and kinetic energy $E$ scatters off a heavy stationary particle of charge $q_{2}$.

**(a) Derive the formula relating the impact parameter to the scattering angle. Answer:** $b=\left(q_{1} q_{2} / 8 \pi \epsilon_{0} E\right) \cot (\theta/2)$.

**(b) Determine the differential scattering cross-section. Answer:**
$$D(\theta)=\left[\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{16 \pi \epsilon_{0} E \sin ^{2}(\theta/2)}\right]^{2} \text { }$$

**(c) Show that the total cross-section for Rutherford scattering is infinite. We say that the $1/r$ potential has "infinite range"**; **you can't escape from a Coulomb force**.

> This isn't easy, and you might want to refer to a book on classical mechanics, such as Jerry B. Marion and Stephen T. Thornton *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems*. 4th ed., Saunders, Fort Worth, TX (1995), Section 9.10.

### 11.1.2 Quantum Scattering Theory

In the quantum theory of scattering, we imagine an **incident plane wave**, $\psi(z)=A e^{i k z}$, traveling in the $z$ direction, which encounters a scattering potential, producing an **outgoing spherical wave** (Figure 11.4). That is, we look for solutions to the Schrödinger equation of the general form
$$\psi(r, \theta) \approx A\left\{e^{i k z}+f(\theta) \frac{e^{i k r}}{r}\right\} \text { }$$
for large $r$. (The spherical wave carries a factor of $1/r$, because this portion of $|\psi|^{2}$ must go like $1/r^{2}$ to conserve probability.)  The wave number $k$ is related to the energy $E$ of the incident particles in the usual way:
$$k \equiv \frac{\sqrt{2 m E}}{\hbar} \text { }$$
As before, I shall assume the target is azimuthally symmetrical ; in the more general case the amplitude $f$ of the outgoing spherical wave could depend on $\phi$ as well as $\theta$.

> For the moment, there's not much quantum mechanics in this: what we're really talking about is the scattering of waves, as opposed to classical particles, and you could even think of Figure 11.4 as a picture of water waves encountering a rock, or (better, since we're interested in three-dimensional scattering) sound waves bouncing off a basketball. In that case we'd write the wave function in the real form $A[\cos(kz)+f(\theta) \cos(kr+\delta)/r]$ , and $f(\theta)$ would represent the amplitude of the scattered sound wave in the direction $\theta$.

> **FIGURE 11.5:** The volume $d V$ of incident beam that passes through area $d \sigma$ in time $d t$.

The whole problem is to determine the **scattering amplitude** $f(\theta)$ ; it tells you the probability of scattering in a given direction $\theta$, and hence is related to the differential cross-section. Indeed, the probability that the incident particle, traveling at speed $v$, passes through the infinitesimal area $d \sigma$, in time $d t$, is (see Figure 11.5) 
$$d P=|\psi_{\text {incident }}|^{2} d V=|A|^{2}(v d t) d \sigma \text { }$$
But this is equal to the probability that the particle scatters into the corresponding solid angle $d \Omega$:
$$d P=|\psi_{\text {scattered }}|^{2} d V=\frac{|A|^{2}|f|^{2}}{r^{2}}(v d t) r^{2} d \Omega \text { }$$
from which it follows that $d \sigma=|f|^{2} d \Omega$ and hence
$$D(\theta)=\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}=|f(\theta)|^{2} \text { }$$
Evidently the differential cross-section (which is the quantity of interest to the experimentalist) is equal to the absolute square of the scattering amplitude (which is obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation). In the following sections we will study two techniques for calculating the scattering amplitude: **partial wave analysis** and the **Born approximation**.

### Problem 11.2

Construct the analogs to Equation 11.12 for one-dimensional and two-dimensional scattering.

## 11.2 PARTIAL WAVE ANALYSIS

### 11.2.1 Formalism

As we found in Chapter 4, the Schrödinger equation for a spherically symmetrical potential $V(r)$ admits the separable solutions 
$$\psi(r, \theta, \phi)=R(r) Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) \text { }$$

---
## 📄 Page 7

where $Y_{l}^{m}$ is a spherical harmonic (Equation 4.32) , and $u(r)=r R(r)$ satisfies the radial equation (Equation 4.37):
$$-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{d^{2} u}{d r^{2}}+\left[V(r)+\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \frac{l(l+1)}{r^{2}}\right] u=E u \text { }$$
At very large $r$ the potential goes to zero, and the centrifugal contribution is negligible, so
$$\frac{d^{2} u}{d r^{2}} \approx-k^{2} u \text { }$$
The general solution is
$$u(r)=C e^{i k r}+D e^{-i k r} \text { }$$
the first term represents an outgoing spherical wave, and the second an incoming one-for the scattered wave we evidently want $D=0$. At very large $r$, then,
$$R(r) \sim \frac{e^{i k r}}{r} \text { }$$
as we already deduced (on physical grounds) in the previous section (Equation 11.12).

That's for very large $r$ (more precisely, for $k r \gg 1$; in optics it would be called the **radiation zone**). As in one-dimensional scattering theory, we assume that the potential is "**localized**," in the sense that exterior to some finite **scattering region** it is essentially zero (Figure 11.6). In the **intermediate region** (where $V$ can be ignored but the centrifugal term cannot), the radial equation becomes 
$$\frac{d^{2} u}{d r^{2}}-\frac{l(l+1)}{r^{2}} u=-k^{2} u \text { }$$

 

> **FIGURE 11.6:** Scattering from a localized potential: the scattering region (darker shading), the intermediate region (lighter shading), and the radiation zone (where $k r \gg 1$).

> What follows does not apply to the Coulomb potential, since $1/r$ goes to zero more slowly than $1/r^{2}$ as $r \rightarrow \infty$, and the centrifugal term does not dominate in this region. In this sense the Coulomb potential is not localized, and partial wave analysis is inapplicable.

> **TABLE 11.1:** Spherical Hankel functions, $h_{l}^{(1)}(x)$ and $h_{l}^{(2)}(x)$.

| $h_{l}^{(1)}(x)$ | $h_{l}^{(2)}(x)$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| $h_{0}^{(1)}=-i \frac{e^{i x}}{x}$ | $h_{0}^{(2)}=i \frac{e^{-i x}}{x}$ |
| $h_{1}^{(1)}=\left(-\frac{i}{x^{2}}-\frac{1}{x}\right) e^{i x}$ | $h_{1}^{(2)}=\left(\frac{i}{x^{2}}-\frac{1}{x}\right) e^{-i x}$ |
| $h_{2}^{(1)}=\left(-\frac{3 i}{x^{3}}-\frac{3}{x^{2}}+\frac{i}{x}\right) e^{i x}$ | $h_{2}^{(2)}=\left(\frac{3 i}{x^{3}}-\frac{3}{x^{2}}+\frac{i}{x}\right) e^{-i x}$ |
| $h_{l}^{(1)} \rightarrow \frac{1}{x}(-i)^{l+1} e^{i x}$ | $h_{l}^{(2)} \rightarrow \frac{1}{x}(i)^{l+1} e^{-i x}$ |
| | for $x \gg 1$ |

and the general solution (Equation 4.45) is a linear combination of spherical Bessel functions:
$$u(r)=A r j_{l}(k r)+B r n_{l}(k r) \text { }$$
However, neither $j_{l}$ (which is somewhat like a sine function) nor $n_{l}$ (which is a sort of generalized cosine function) represents an outgoing (or an incoming) wave. What we need are the linear combinations analogous to $e^{i k r}$ and $e^{-i k r}$; these are known as **spherical Hankel functions**:
$$h_{l}^{(1)}(x) \equiv j_{l}(x)+i n_{l}(x); \quad h_{l}^{(2)}(x) \equiv j_{l}(x)-i n_{l}(x) \text { }$$
The first few spherical Hankel functions are listed in Table 11.1. At large $r$, $h_{l}^{(1)}(k r)$ (the "**Hankel function of the first kind**") goes like $e^{i k r} / r$, whereas $h_{l}^{(2)}(k r)$ (the "**Hankel function of the second kind**") goes like $e^{-i k r} / r$ ; for outgoing waves, then, we need spherical Hankel functions of the first kind:
$$R(r) \sim h_{l}^{(1)}(k r) \text { }$$
Thus the exact wave function, outside the scattering region (where $V(r)=0$), is 
$$\psi(r, \theta, \phi)=A\left\{e^{i k z}+\sum_{l, m} C_{l, m} h_{l}^{(1)}(k r) Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi)\right\} \text { }$$
The first term is the incident plane wave, and the sum (with expansion coefficients $C_{l, m}$) represents the scattered wave. But since we are assuming the potential is spherically symmetric, the wave function cannot depend on $\phi$.

> There's nothing wrong with $\phi$ dependence, of course, because the incoming plane wave defines a $z$ direction, breaking the spherical symmetry. But the azimuthal symmetry remains: the incident plane wave has no $\phi$ dependence, and there is nothing in the scattering process that could introduce any $\phi$ dependence in the outgoing wave.

---

So only terms with $m=0$ survive (remember, $Y_{l}^{m} \sim e^{i m \phi}$). Now (from Equations 4.27 and 4.32)
$$Y_{l}^{0}(\theta, \phi)=\sqrt{\frac{2 l+1}{4 \pi}} P_{l}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$
where $P_{l}$ is the $l$th Legendre polynomial. It is customary to redefine the expansion coefficients, letting $C_{l, 0} \equiv i^{l+1} k \sqrt{4 \pi(2 l+1)} a_{l}$;
$$\psi(r, \theta)=A\left\{e^{i k z}+k \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} i^{l+1}(2 l+1) a_{l} h_{l}^{(1)}(k r) P_{l}(\cos \theta)\right\} \text { }$$
You'll see in a moment why this peculiar notation is convenient; $a_{l}$ is called the **$l$th partial wave amplitude**.

Now, for very large $r$ the Hankel function goes like $(-i)^{l+1} e^{i k r} / k r$ (Table 11.1), so
$$\psi(r, \theta) \approx A\left\{e^{i k z}+f(\theta) \frac{e^{i k r}}{r}\right\} \text { }$$
where
$$f(\theta)=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}(2 l+1) a_{l} P_{l}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$
This confirms more rigorously the general structure postulated in Equation 11.12, and tells us how to compute the scattering amplitude, $f(\theta)$, in terms of the partial wave amplitudes ($a_{l}$).

The differential cross-section is
$$D(\theta)=|f(\theta)|^{2}=\sum_{l} \sum_{l^{\prime}}(2 l+1)\left(2 l^{\prime}+1\right) a_{l}^{*} a_{l^{\prime}} P_{l}(\cos \theta) P_{l^{\prime}}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$
and the total cross-section is
$$\sigma=4 \pi \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}(2 l+1)\left|a_{l}\right|^{2} \text { }$$
(I used the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials, Equation 4.34, to do the angular integration.) 

### 11.2.2 Strategy

All that remains is to determine the partial wave amplitudes, $a_{l}$, for the potential in question. This is accomplished by solving the Schrödinger equation in the interior region (where $V(r)$ is distinctly non-zero), and matching this to the exterior solution (Equation 11.23), using the appropriate boundary conditions. The only problem is

## 📄 Page 10

that as it stands my notation is hybrid: I used spherical coordinates for the scattered wave, but cartesian coordinates for the incident wave. We need to rewrite the wave function in a more consistent notation.

Of course, $e^{i k z}$ satisfies the Schrödinger equation with $V=0$. On the other hand, I just argued that the general solution to the Schrödinger equation with $V=0$ can be written in the form 
$$\sum_{l, m}\left[A_{l, m} j_{l}(k r)+B_{l, m} n_{l}(k r)\right] Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) \text { }$$
In particular, then, it must be possible to express $e^{i k z}$ in this way. But $e^{i k z}$ is finite at the origin, so no Neumann functions are allowed ($n_{l}(k r)$ blows up at $r=0$), and since $z=r \cos \theta$ has no $\phi$ dependence, only $m=0$ terms occur. The explicit expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical waves is known as **Rayleigh's formula**:
$$e^{i k z}=\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} i^{l}(2 l+1) j_{l}(k r) P_{l}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$
Using this, the wave function in the exterior region can be expressed entirely in terms of $r$ and $\theta$:
$$\psi(r, \theta)=A \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} i^{l}(2 l+1)\left[j_{l}(k r)+i k a_{l} h_{l}^{(1)}(k r)\right] P_{l}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$

### Example 11.3 Quantum hard-sphere scattering.

Suppose
$$V(r)=\begin{cases}\infty, & \text { for } r \le a \\ 0, & \text { for } r>a\end{cases} \text { }$$
The boundary condition, then, is
$$\psi(a, \theta)=0 \text { }$$
so
$$\sum_{l=0}^{\infty} i^{l}(2 l+1)\left[j_{l}(k a)+i k a_{l} h_{l}^{(1)}(k a)\right] P_{l}(\cos \theta)=0 \text { }$$
for all $\theta$, from which it follows (Problem 11.3) that
$$a_{l}=i \frac{j_{l}(k a)}{k h_{l}^{(1)}(k a)} \text { }$$

In particular, the total cross-section is
$$\sigma=\frac{4 \pi}{k^{2}} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}(2 l+1)\left|\frac{j_{l}(k a)}{h_{l}^{(1)}(k a)}\right|^{2} \text { }$$
That's the exact answer, but it's not terribly illuminating, so let's consider the limiting case of **low-energy scattering**: $k a \ll 1$ (Since $k=2 \pi / \lambda$, this amounts to saying that the wavelength is much greater than the radius of the sphere.)  Referring to Table 4.4, we note that $n_{l}(z)$ is much larger than $j_{l}(z)$ for small $z$, so
$$\frac{j_{l}(z)}{h_{l}^{(1)}(z)}=\frac{j_{l}(z)}{j_{l}(z)+i n_{l}(z)} \approx-i \frac{j_{l}(z)}{n_{l}(z)} \text { }$$
and hence
$$\approx-i \frac{2^{l} l ! z^{l} /(2 l+1) !}{-(2 l) ! z^{-l-1} / 2^{l} l !}=\frac{i}{2 l+1}\left[\frac{2^{l} l !}{(2 l) !}\right]^{2} z^{2 l+1} \text { }$$
$$\sigma \approx \frac{4 \pi}{k^{2}} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2 l+1}\left[\frac{2^{l} l !}{(2 l) !}\right]^{4}(k a)^{4 l+2} \text { }$$
But we're assuming $k a \ll 1$, so the higher powers are negligible-in the low-energy approximation the scattering is dominated by the $l=0$ term. (This means that the differential cross-section is independent of $\theta$, just as it was in the classical case.)  Evidently
$$\sigma \approx 4 \pi a^{2} \text { }$$
for low energy hard-sphere scattering. Surprisingly, the scattering cross-section is **four times the geometrical cross-section**-in fact, $\sigma$ is the total surface area of the sphere. This "**larger effective size**" is characteristic of long-wavelength scattering (it would be true in optics, as well) ; in a sense, these waves "feel" their way around the whole sphere, whereas classical particles only see the head-on cross-section.

### Problem 11.3

Prove Equation 11.33, starting with Equation 11.32. **Hint:** Exploit the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials to show that the coefficients with different values of $l$ must separately vanish.

### **Problem 11.4**

Consider the case of low-energy scattering from a **spherical delta-function shell**:
$$V(r)=\alpha \delta(r-a) \text { }$$
where $\alpha$ and $a$ are constants. Calculate the scattering amplitude, $f(\theta)$, the differential cross-section, $D(\theta)$, and the total cross-section, $\sigma$. Assume $k a \ll 1$, so that

## 📄 Page 12

only the $l=0$ term contributes significantly. (To simplify matters, throw out all $l \ne 0$ terms right from the start.) The main problem, of course, is to determine $a_{0}$. Express your answer in terms of the dimensionless quantity $\beta \equiv 2 m a \alpha / \hbar^{2}$. **Answer:** $\sigma=4 \pi a^{2} \beta^{2} /(1+\beta)^{2}$.

## 11.3 PHASE SHIFTS

Consider first the problem of one-dimensional scattering from a localized potential $V(x)$ on the half-line $x<0$ (Figure 11.7). I'll put a "**brick wall**" at $x=0$, so a wave incident from the left,
$$\psi_{i}(x)=A e^{i k x} \quad(x<-a) \text { }$$
is entirely reflected 
$$\psi_{r}(x)=B e^{-i k x} \quad(x<-a) \text { }$$
Whatever happens in the interaction region $(-a<x<0)$, the amplitude of the reflected wave has got to be the same as that of the incident wave, by **conservation of probability**. But it need not have the same phase. If there were no potential at all (just the wall at $x=0$), then $B=-A$, since the total wave function (incident plus reflected) must vanish at the origin:
$$\psi_{0}(x)=A\left(e^{i k x}-e^{-i k x}\right) \quad(V(x)=0) \text { }$$
If the potential is not zero, the wave function (for $x<-a$) takes the form
$$\psi(x)=A\left(e^{i k x}-e^{i(2 \delta-k x)}\right) \quad(V(x) \ne 0) \text { }$$

 

> **FIGURE 11.7:** One-dimensional scattering from a localized potential bounded on the right by an infinite wall.

## 📄 Page 13

The whole theory of scattering reduces to the problem of calculating the **phase shift** $\delta$ (as a function of $k$, and hence of the energy $E=\hbar^{2} k^{2} / 2 m$) for a specified potential. We do this, of course, by solving the Schrödinger equation in the scattering region $(-a<x<0)$, and imposing appropriate boundary conditions (see Problem 11.5). The virtue of working with the phase shift (as opposed to the complex amplitude $B$) is that it illuminates the physics (because of conservation of probability, all the potential can do is shift the phase of the reflected wave) and simplifies the mathematics (trading a complex quantity-two real numbers-for a single real quantity).

Now let's return to the three-dimensional case. The incident plane wave $(A e^{i k z})$ carries no angular momentum in the $z$ direction (Rayleigh's formula contains no terms with $m \ne 0$), but it includes all values of the total angular momentum $(l=0, 1, 2, \dots)$. Because angular momentum is conserved (by a spherically symmetric potential), each partial wave (labelled by a particular $l$) scatters independently, with (again) no change in amplitude-only in **phase**. If there is no potential at all, then $\psi_{0}=A e^{i k z}$, and the $l$th partial wave is (Equation 11.28):
$$\psi_{0}^{(l)}=A i^{l}(2 l+1) j_{l}(k r) P_{l}(\cos \theta) \quad(V(r)=0) \text { }$$
But (from Equation 11.19 and Table 11.1)
$$j_{l}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[h_{l}^{(1)}(x)+h_{l}^{(2)}(x)\right] \approx \frac{1}{2 x}\left[(-i)^{l+1} e^{i x}+i^{l+1} e^{-i x}\right] \quad(x \gg 1) \text { }$$
So for large $r$
$$\psi_{0}^{(l)} \approx A \frac{(2 l+1)}{2 i k r}\left[e^{i k r}-(-1)^{l} e^{-i k r}\right] P_{l}(\cos \theta) \quad(V(r)=0) \text { }$$
The second term in square brackets represents an incoming spherical wave; it is unchanged when we introduce the scattering potential. The first term is the outgoing wave; it picks up a phase shift $\delta_{l}$:
$$\psi^{(l)} \approx A \frac{(2 l+1)}{2 i k r}\left[e^{i\left(k r+2 \delta_{l}\right)}-(-1)^{l} e^{-i k r}\right] P_{l}(\cos \theta) \quad(V(r) \ne 0) \text { }$$
Think of it as a converging spherical wave (due exclusively to the $h_{l}^{(2)}$ component in $e^{i k z}$), which is phase shifted $2 \delta_{l}$ (see footnote 7) and emerges as an outgoing spherical wave (the $h_{l}^{(1)}$ part of $e^{i k z}$ as well as the scattered wave itself).

> The 2 in front of $\delta$ is conventional. We think of the incident wave as being phase shifted once on the way in, and again on the way out ; by $\delta$ we mean the "one way" phase shift, and the total is therefore $2 \delta$.
> One reason this subject can be so confusing is that practically everything is called an "amplitude": $f(\theta)$ is the "scattering amplitude," $a_{l}$ is the "partial wave amplitude," but the first is a function of $\theta$, and both are complex numbers. I'm now talking about "amplitude" in the original sense: the (real, of course) height of a sinusoidal wave.

In Section 11.2.1 the whole theory was expressed in terms of the partial wave amplitudes $a_{l}$ ; now we have formulated it in terms of the phase shifts $\delta_{l}$. There must be a connection between the two. Indeed, comparing the asymptotic (large $r$) form of Equation 11.23 
$$\psi^{(l)} \approx A\left\{\frac{(2 l+1)}{2 i k r}\left[e^{i k r}-(-1)^{l} e^{-i k r}\right]+\frac{(2 l+1)}{r} a_{l} e^{i k r}\right\} P_{l}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$
with the generic expression in terms of $\delta_{l}$ (Equation 11.44), we find
$$a_{l}=\frac{1}{2 i k}\left(e^{2 i \delta_{l}}-1\right)=\frac{1}{k} e^{i \delta_{l}} \sin \left(\delta_{l}\right) \text { }$$
It follows in particular (Equation 11.25) that
$$f(\theta)=\frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}(2 l+1) e^{i \delta_{l}} \sin \left(\delta_{l}\right) P_{l}(\cos \theta) \text { }$$
and (Equation 11.27)
$$\sigma=\frac{4 \pi}{k^{2}} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}(2 l+1) \sin ^{2}\left(\delta_{l}\right) \text { }$$
Again, the advantage of working with phase shifts (as opposed to partial wave amplitudes) is that they are easier to interpret physically, and simpler mathematically; the phase shift formalism exploits conservation of angular momentum to reduce a complex quantity $a_{l}$ (two real numbers) to a single real one $\delta_{l}$.

### Problem 11.5

A particle of mass $m$ and energy $E$ is incident from the left on the potential
$$V(x)=\begin{cases}0, & (x<-a) \\ -V_{0}, & (-a \le x \le 0) \\ \infty, & (x>0)\end{cases} \text { }$$

**(a) If the incoming wave is $A e^{i k x}$ (where $k=\sqrt{2 m E} / \hbar$), find the reflected wave. Answer:**
$$A e^{-2 i k a}\left[\frac{k-i k^{\prime} \cot \left(k^{\prime} a\right)}{k+i k^{\prime} \cot \left(k^{\prime} a\right)}\right] e^{-i k x}, \text { where } k^{\prime}=\sqrt{2 m\left(E+V_{0}\right)} / \hbar \text { }$$

> Although I used the asymptotic form of the wave function to draw the connection between $a_{l}$ and $\delta_{l}$ , there is nothing approximate about the result (Equation 11.46). Both of them are constants (independent of $r$) , and $\delta_{l}$ means the phase shift in the asymptotic region (where the Hankel functions have settled down to $e^{\pm i k r} / k r$).

**(b) Confirm that the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident wave**.

**(c) Find the phase shift $\delta$ (Equation 11.40) for a very deep well ($E \ll V_{0}$). Answer:** $\delta=-k a$.

### Problem 11.6

What are the partial wave phase shifts ($\delta_{l}$) for hard-sphere scattering (Example 11.3)? 

### Problem 11.7

Find the $S$-wave ($l=0$) partial wave phase shift $\delta_{0}(k)$ for scattering from a delta-function shell (Problem 11.4). Assume that the radial wave function $u(r)$ goes to 0 as $r \rightarrow \infty$. **Answer:**
$$-\cot ^{-1}\left[\cot (k a)+\frac{k a}{\beta \sin ^{2}(k a)}\right] \text { where } \beta \equiv \frac{2 m \alpha a}{\hbar^{2}} \text { }$$

## 11.4 THE BORN APPROXIMATION

### 11.4.1 Integral Form of the Schrödinger Equation

The time-independent Schrödinger equation,
$$-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \nabla^{2} \psi+V \psi=E \psi \text { }$$
can be written more succinctly as
$$\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) \psi=Q \text { }$$
where
$$k \equiv \frac{\sqrt{2 m E}}{\hbar} \text { and } Q \equiv \frac{2 m}{\hbar^{2}} V \psi \text { }$$
This has the superficial form of the Helmholtz equation ; note, however, that the "inhomogeneous" term ($Q$) itself depends on $\psi$.

Suppose we could find a function $G(\mathbf{r})$ that solves the Helmholtz equation with a delta function "source":
$$\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) G(\mathbf{r})=\delta^{3}(\mathbf{r}) \text { }$$
Then we could express $\psi$ as an integral:
$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\int G(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}) Q(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$

---
## 📄 Page 16

For it is easy to show that this satisfies Schrödinger's equation, in the form of Equation 11.50:
$$\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) \psi(\mathbf{r})=\int\left[\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) G(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0})\right] Q(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0}$$
$$=\int \delta^{3}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}) Q(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0}=Q(\mathbf{r}) \text { }$$
$G(\mathbf{r})$ is called the **Green's function** for the Helmholtz equation. (In general, the Green's function for a linear differential equation represents the "response" to a delta-function source.) 

Our first task ${}^{10}$ is to solve Equation 11.52 for $G(\mathbf{r})$. This is most easily accomplished by taking the **Fourier transform**, which turns the differential equation into an algebraic equation. Let
$$G(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3 / 2}} \int e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}} g(\mathbf{s}) d^{3} \mathbf{s} \text { }$$
Then
$$\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) G(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3 / 2}} \int\left[\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}}\right] g(\mathbf{s}) d^{3} \mathbf{s} \text { }$$
But
$$\nabla^{2} e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}}=-s^{2} e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}} \text { }$$
and (see Equation 2.144)
$$\delta^{3}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \int e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}} d^{3} \mathbf{s} \text { }$$
so Equation 11.52 says
$$\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3 / 2}} \int\left(-s^{2}+k^{2}\right) e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}} g(\mathbf{s}) d^{3} \mathbf{s}=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \int e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}} d^{3} \mathbf{s} \text { }$$
It follows ${}^{11}$ that
$$g(\mathbf{s})=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3 / 2}\left(k^{2}-s^{2}\right)} \text { }$$
Putting this back into Equation 11.54, we find:
$$G(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \int e^{i \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}} \frac{1}{\left(k^{2}-s^{2}\right)} d^{3} \mathbf{s} \text { }$$

> ${}^{10}$ **Warning:** You are approaching two pages of heavy analysis, including contour integrals. If you wish, skip straight to the answer, Equation 11.65.
> ${}^{11}$ This is clearly sufficient, but it is also necessary, as you can show by combining the two terms into a single integral, and using Plancherel's theorem, Equation 2.102.

> **FIGURE 11.8:** Convenient coordinates for the integral in Equation 11.58.

Now, $\mathbf{r}$ is fixed, as far as the $\mathbf{s}$ integration is concerned, so we may as well choose spherical coordinates ($s, \theta, \phi$) with the polar axis along $\mathbf{r}$ (Figure 11.8). Then $\mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{r}=s r \cos \theta$; the $\phi$ integral is trivial ($2 \pi$), and the $\theta$ integral is
$$\int_{0}^{\pi} e^{i s r \cos \theta} \sin \theta d \theta=-\left.\frac{e^{i s r \cos \theta}}{i s r}\right|_{0}^{\pi}=\frac{2 \sin (s r)}{s r} \text { }$$
Thus
$$G(r)=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{2}{r} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{s \sin (s r)}{k^{2}-s^{2}} d s=\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2} r} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{s \sin (s r)}{k^{2}-s^{2}} d s \text { }$$
The remaining integral is not so simple. It pays to revert to exponential notation, and factor the denominator:
$$G(r)=\frac{i}{8 \pi^{2} r}\left\{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{s e^{i s r}}{(s-k)(s+k)} d s-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{s e^{-i s r}}{(s-k)(s+k)} d s\right\}$$
$$=\frac{i}{8 \pi^{2} r}\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \text { }$$
These two integrals can be evaluated using **Cauchy's integral formula**:
$$\oint \frac{f(z)}{\left(z-z_{0}\right)} d z=2 \pi i f\left(z_{0}\right) \text { }$$
if $z_{0}$ lies within the contour (otherwise the integral is zero). In the present case the integration is along the real axis, and it passes right over the pole singularities at $\pm k$. We have to decide how to skirt the poles-I'll go over the one at $-k$ and under the one at $+k$ (Figure 11.9). (You're welcome to choose some other convention if you like-even winding seven times around each pole-you'll get a different Green's function, but, as I'll show you in a minute, they're all equally acceptable.) 

For each integral in Equation 11.61 we must "**close the contour**" in such a way that the semicircle at infinity contributes nothing. In the case of $I_{1}$, the factor

---
## 📄 Page 18

 

> **FIGURE 11.9:** Skirting the poles in the contour integral (Equation 11.61).

$e^{i s r}$ goes to zero when $s$ has a large positive imaginary part; for this one we close above (Figure 11.10(a)). The contour encloses only the singularity at $s=+k$, so
$$I_{1}=\oint\left[\frac{s e^{i s r}}{s+k}\right] \frac{1}{s-k} d s=2 \pi i\left[\frac{s e^{i s r}}{s+k}\right]_{s=k}=i \pi e^{i k r} \text { }$$
In the case of $I_{2}$, the factor $e^{-i s r}$ goes to zero when $s$ has a large negative imaginary part, so we close below (Figure 11.10(b)) ; this time the contour encloses the singularity at $s=-k$ (and it goes around in the clockwise direction, so we pick up a minus sign):
$$I_{2}=-\oint\left[\frac{s e^{-i s r}}{s-k}\right] \frac{1}{s+k} d s=-2 \pi i\left[\frac{s e^{-i s r}}{s-k}\right]_{s=-k}=-i \pi e^{i k r} \text { }$$
Conclusion:
$$G(r)=\frac{i}{8 \pi^{2} r}\left[\left(i \pi e^{i k r}\right)-\left(-i \pi e^{i k r}\right)\right]=-\frac{e^{i k r}}{4 \pi r} \text { }$$
This, finally, is the Green's function for the Helmholtz equation-the solution to Equation 11.52. (If you got lost in all that analysis, you might want to check the result by direct differentiation-see Problem 11.8.)  Or rather, it is *a* Green's function for the Helmholtz equation, for we can add to $G(\mathbf{r})$ any function $G_{0}(\mathbf{r})$ that satisfies the **homogeneous Helmholtz equation**:
$$\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) G_{0}(\mathbf{r})=0 \text { }$$

 

> **FIGURE 11.10:** Closing the contour in Equations 11.63 and 11.64.

---
## 📄 Page 19

clearly, the result $(G+G_{0})$ still satisfies Equation 11.52. This ambiguity corresponds precisely to the ambiguity in how to skirt the poles-a different choice amounts to picking a different function $G_{0}(\mathbf{r})$.

Returning to Equation 11.53, the general solution to the Schrödinger equation takes the form
$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\psi_{0}(\mathbf{r})-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \int \frac{e^{i k\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}\right|}}{\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}\right|} V(\mathbf{r}_{0}) \psi(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$
where $\psi_{0}$ satisfies the free-particle Schrödinger equation,
$$\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right) \psi_{0}=0 \text { }$$
Equation 11.67 is the **integral form of the Schrödinger equation**; it is entirely equivalent to the more familiar differential form. At first glance it looks like an explicit solution to the Schrödinger equation (for any potential)-which is too good to be true. Don't be deceived: There's a $\psi$ under the integral sign on the right hand side, so you can't do the integral unless you already know the solution!  Nevertheless, the integral form can be very powerful, and it is particularly well suited to scattering problems, as we'll see in the following section.

### Problem 11.8

Check that Equation 11.65 satisfies Equation 11.52, by direct substitution. **Hint:** $\nabla^{2}(1/r)=-4 \pi \delta^{3}(\mathbf{r})$.${}^{12}$

### **Problem 11.9**

Show that the ground state of hydrogen (Equation 4.80) satisfies the integral form of the Schrödinger equation, for the appropriate $V$ and $E$ (note that $E$ is negative, so $k=i \kappa$, where $\kappa \equiv \sqrt{-2 m E} / \hbar$).

### 11.4.2 The First Born Approximation

Suppose $V(\mathbf{r}_{0})$ is localized about $\mathbf{r}_{0}=0$ (that is, the potential drops to zero outside some finite region, as is typical for a scattering problem) , and we want to calculate $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ at points far away from the scattering center. Then $|\mathbf{r}| \gg |\mathbf{r}_{0}|$ for all points that contribute to the integral in Equation 11.67, so
$$|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}|^{2}=r^{2}+r_{0}^{2}-2 \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0} \cong r^{2}\left(1-2 \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}}{r^{2}}\right) \text { }$$
and hence
$$|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}| \cong r-\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$

> ${}^{12}$ See, for example, D. Griffiths, *Introduction to Electrodynamics*, 3rd ed. (Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1999), Section 1.5.3.

## 📄 Page 20

Let
$$\mathbf{k} \equiv k \hat{\mathbf{r}} \text { }$$
then
$$e^{i k\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}\right|} \cong e^{i k r} e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}} \text { }$$
and therefore
$$\frac{e^{i k\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}\right|}}{\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}\right|} \cong \frac{e^{i k r}}{r} e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}} \text { }$$
(In the denominator we can afford to make the more radical approximation $|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}| \cong r$; in the exponent we need to keep the next term. If this puzzles you, try writing out the next term in the expansion of the denominator. What we are doing is expanding in powers of the small quantity ($r_{0} / r$), and dropping all but the lowest order.) 

In the case of scattering, we want
$$\psi_{0}(\mathbf{r})=A e^{i k z} \text { }$$
representing an incident plane wave. For large $r$, then,
$$\psi(\mathbf{r}) \cong A e^{i k z}-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \frac{e^{i k r}}{r} \int e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}} V(\mathbf{r}_{0}) \psi(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$
This is in the standard form (Equation 11.12) , and we can read off the scattering amplitude:
$$f(\theta, \phi)=-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2} A} \int e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}} V(\mathbf{r}_{0}) \psi(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$
So far, this is exact. Now we invoke the **Born approximation**: Suppose the incoming plane wave is not substantially altered by the potential; then it makes sense to use
$$\psi(\mathbf{r}_{0}) \approx \psi_{0}(\mathbf{r}_{0})=A e^{i k z_{0}}=A e^{i \mathbf{k}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}} \text { }$$
where
$$\mathbf{k}^{\prime} \equiv k \hat{\mathbf{z}} \text { }$$
inside the integral. (This would be the exact wave function, if $V$ were zero; it is essentially a **weak potential approximation** ${}^{13}$) . In the Born approximation, then,
$$f(\theta, \phi) \cong-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \int e^{i\left(\mathbf{k}^{\prime}-\mathbf{k}\right) \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}} V(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$

> ${}^{13}$ Generally, partial wave analysis is useful when the incident particle has low energy, for then only the first few terms in the series contribute significantly ; the Born approximation applies when the potential is weak, compared to the incident energy, so the deflection is small.

## 📄 Page 21

 

> **FIGURE 11.11:** Two wave vectors in the Born approximation: $\mathbf{k}^{\prime}$ points in the incident direction, $\mathbf{k}$ in the scattered direction.

(In case you have lost track of the definitions of $\mathbf{k}^{\prime}$ and $\mathbf{k}$, they both have magnitude $k$, but the former points in the direction of the incident beam, while the latter points toward the detector-see Figure 11.11; $\hbar(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}^{\prime})$ is the **momentum transfer** in the process.) 

In particular, for low energy (long wavelength) scattering, the exponential factor is essentially constant over the scattering region, and the Born approximation simplifies to 
$$f(\theta, \phi) \cong-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \int V(\mathbf{r}) d^{3} \mathbf{r} \quad \text { (low energy) } \text { }$$
(I dropped the subscript on $\mathbf{r}$, since there is no likelihood of confusion at this point.) 

### Example 11.4 Low-energy soft-sphere scattering. ${}^{14}$

Suppose
$$V(r)=\begin{cases}V_{0}, & \text { if } r \le a \\ 0, & \text { if } r>a\end{cases} \text { }$$
In this case the low-energy scattering amplitude is
$$f(\theta, \phi) \cong-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} V_{0}\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi a^{3}\right) \text { }$$
(independent of $\theta$ and $\phi$) , the differential cross-section is
$$\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}=|f|^{2} \cong\left(\frac{2 m V_{0} a^{3}}{3 \hbar^{2}}\right)^{2} \text { }$$
and the total cross-section is
$$\sigma \cong 4 \pi\left(\frac{2 m V_{0} a^{3}}{3 \hbar^{2}}\right)^{2} \text { }$$

> ${}^{14}$ You can't apply the Born approximation to hard-sphere scattering ($V_{0}=\infty$); the integral blows up. The point is that we assumed the potential is weak, and doesn't change the wave function much in the scattering region. But a hard sphere changes it radically-from $A e^{i k z}$ to zero.

---
## 📄 Page 22

For a spherically symmetrical potential, $V(\mathbf{r})=V(r)$-but not necessarily at low energy-the Born approximation again reduces to a simpler form. Define
$$\mathbf{\kappa} \equiv \mathbf{k}^{\prime}-\mathbf{k} \text { }$$
and let the polar axis for the $\mathbf{r}_{0}$ integral lie along $\mathbf{\kappa}$, so that
$$\left(\mathbf{k}^{\prime}-\mathbf{k}\right) \cdot \mathbf{r}_{0}=\kappa r_{0} \cos \theta_{0} \text { }$$
Then
$$f(\theta) \cong-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \int e^{i \kappa r_{0} \cos \theta_{0}} V(r_{0}) r_{0}^{2} \sin \theta_{0} d r_{0} d \theta_{0} d \phi_{0} \text { }$$
The $\phi_{0}$ integral is trivial ($2 \pi$), and the $\theta_{0}$ integral is one we have encountered before (see Equation 11.59). Dropping the subscript on $r$, we are left with
$$f(\theta) \cong-\frac{2 m}{\hbar^{2} \kappa} \int_{0}^{\infty} r V(r) \sin (\kappa r) d r \quad \text { (spherical symmetry) } \text { }$$
The angular dependence of $f$ is carried by $\kappa$; in Figure 11.11 we see that
$$\kappa=2 k \sin (\theta/2) \text { }$$

### Example 11.5 Yukawa scattering.

The **Yukawa potential** (which is a crude model for the binding force in an atomic nucleus) has the form 
$$V(r)=\beta \frac{e^{-\mu r}}{r} \text { }$$
where $\beta$ and $\mu$ are constants. The Born approximation gives
$$f(\theta) \cong-\frac{2 m \beta}{\hbar^{2} \kappa} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\mu r} \sin (\kappa r) d r=-\frac{2 m \beta}{\hbar^{2}\left(\mu^{2}+\kappa^{2}\right)} \text { }$$
(You get to work out the integral for yourself, in Problem 11.11.) 

### Example 11.6 Rutherford scattering.

If we put in $\beta=q_{1} q_{2} / 4 \pi \epsilon_{0}$, $\mu=0$, the Yukawa potential reduces to the **Coulomb potential**, describing the electrical interaction of two point charges. Evidently the scattering amplitude is
$$f(\theta) \cong-\frac{2 m q_{1} q_{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \hbar^{2} \kappa^{2}} \text { }$$

---
## 📄 Page 23

or (using Equations 11.89 and 11.51):
$$f(\theta) \cong-\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{16 \pi \epsilon_{0} E \sin ^{2}(\theta/2)} \text { }$$
The differential cross-section is the square of this:
$$\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}=\left[\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{16 \pi \epsilon_{0} E \sin ^{2}(\theta/2)}\right]^{2} \text { }$$
which is precisely the **Rutherford formula** (Equation 11.11). It happens that for the Coulomb potential, classical mechanics, the Born approximation, and quantum field theory all yield the same result. As they say in the computer business, the Rutherford formula is amazingly "**robust**".

**(c) show that your results are consistent with the answer to Problem 11.4, in the appropriate regime**.

### 11.4.3 The Born Series

The Born approximation is similar in spirit to the **impulse approximation** in classical scattering theory. In the impulse approximation we begin by pretending

---
## 📄 Page 24

 

> **FIGURE 11.12:** The impulse approximation assumes that the particle continues undeflected, and calculates the transverse momentum delivered.

that the particle keeps going in a straight line (Figure 11.12), and compute the transverse impulse that would be delivered to it in that case:
$$I=\int F_{\perp} d t \text { }$$
If the deflection is relatively small, this should be a good approximation to the transverse momentum imparted to the particle, and hence the scattering angle is 
$$\theta \cong \tan ^{-1}(I / p) \text { }$$
where $p$ is the incident momentum. This is, if you like, the "**first-order**" impulse approximation (the zeroth-order is what we started with: no deflection at all).

Likewise, in the zeroth-order Born approximation the incident plane wave passes by with no modification, and what we explored in the previous section is really the **first-order correction** to this. But the same idea can be iterated to generate a series of higher-order corrections, which presumably converge to the exact answer.

The integral form of the Schrödinger equation reads
$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\psi_{0}(\mathbf{r})+\int g(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{0}) V(\mathbf{r}_{0}) \psi(\mathbf{r}_{0}) d^{3} \mathbf{r}_{0} \text { }$$
where $\psi_{0}$ is the incident wave,
$$g(\mathbf{r}) \equiv-\frac{m}{2 \pi \hbar^{2}} \frac{e^{i k r}}{r} \text { }$$
is the Green's function (into which I have now incorporated the factor $2 m / \hbar^{2}$ for convenience) , and $V$ is the scattering potential. Schematically,
$$\psi=\psi_{0}+\int g V \psi \text { }$$
Suppose we take this expression for $\psi$, and plug it in under the integral sign:
$$\psi=\psi_{0}+\int g V \psi_{0}+\iint g V g V \psi \text { }$$

---
## 📄 Page 25

 

> **FIGURE 11.13:** Diagrammatic interpretation of the Born series (Equation 11.101).

Iterating this procedure, we obtain a formal series for $\psi$:
$$\psi=\psi_{0}+\int g V \psi_{0}+\iint g V g V \psi_{0}+\iiint g V g V g V \psi_{0}+\cdots \text { }$$
In each integrand only the incident wave function ($\psi_{0}$) appears, together with more and more powers of $g V$. The first Born approximation truncates the series after the second term, but it is pretty clear how one generates the higher-order corrections. The **Born series** can be represented diagrammatically as shown in Figure 11.13. In zeroth order $\psi$ is untouched by the potential ; in first order it is "**kicked**" once, and then "**propagates**" out in some new direction ; in second order it is kicked, propagates to a new location, is kicked again, and then propagates out ; and so on. In this context the Green's function is sometimes called the **propagator**-it tells you how the disturbance propagates between one interaction and the next. The Born series was the inspiration for Feynman's formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics, which is expressed entirely in terms of **vertex factors** ($V$) and **propagators** ($g$), connected together in **Feynman diagrams**.
